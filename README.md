# Advent of Code 2021 in Kotlin

Hi! I'm Viktor `<qbit86@gmail.com>`, software developer from Russia.
Here I'm going to solve a couple of puzzles from Advent of Code 2021 [1] in Kotlin.
This repository is created using Advent of Code Kotlin Template by JetBrains [2] as a part of the challenge [3].

The solutions are organized as branches in this repository, not subfolders in the main branch as suggested.
For example, solution for “Day 4: Giant Squid” is placed under **feature/day-04** branch.

I'm not very familiar with Kotlin and programming for JVM, but I'll do my best to follow conventions [4] and idioms [5].
